\section*{Style}

An emphasis has been placed on normalisation to a single simpler and less ambiguous style for referring to people, despite conventions that have varied through history and have varied for people based on their status. References to people have been normalised to be their initials followed by their surname. Knights have their first name written in full. Peers have their title written after their name, unless their title is the same as their name, and titles always include the ordinal. Titles are given as at the time relevant to the context, but for clarity the title that someone is most known for is also noted. Ranks are abbreviated using the modern convention, with ranks not in common use written in full. Regiments are written in abbreviation in parentheses, except when it is obvious from context. Other postnominals aren't listed.

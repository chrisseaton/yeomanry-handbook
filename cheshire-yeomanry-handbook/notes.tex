\section*{Style}

An emphasis has been placed on normalisation to a single simpler and less ambiguous style for referring to people, despite conventions that have varied through history and have varied for people based on their status. References to people have been normalised to be their initials followed by their surname. Knights have their first name written in full. Peers have their title written after their name, and titles always include the ordinal. Ranks are abbreviated using the modern convention, with ranks not in common use written in full.

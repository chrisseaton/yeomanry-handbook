# Do Ye Ken John Peel

## Words

Do ye ken John Peel with his coat so grey?  
Do ye ken John Peel at the break of the day?  
Do ye ken John Peel when he's far, far away  
With his hounds and his horn in the morning.

*Twas the sound of his horn brought me from my bed  
And the cry of his hounds has me oft times led  
For Peel's 'view hal-loo' would awaken the dead  
Or a fox from his lair in the morning*

Do ye ken that hound whose voice is death?  
Do ye ken her sons of peerless faith  
Do ye ken that a fox with his last breath  
Cursed them all as he died in the morning?

*Chorus*

Yes, I ken John Peel and Ruby, too  
Ranter and Royal, Bellham so true  
From the drag to the chase, from the chase to the view  
From the view to the death in the morning.

*Chorus*

And I've followed JOhn Peel both often and far  
O'er the rasper fence and the gate and the bar  
From Low Denton Holme to the Scratchmere Scar  
When we vied for the brush in the morning.

*Chorus*

Then here's to John Peel with my heart and soul  
Come fill, fill to him a brimming bowl  
For We'll follow John Peel thro fair or thro foul  
While we're waked by his horn in the morning.

*Chorus*

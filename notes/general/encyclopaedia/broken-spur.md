## Background

In the First World War the Yeomanry were dismounted for the first time. 74th (Yeomanry) Division was the division that contained the dismounted Yeomanry. Its divisional insignia was the broken spur.

## Insignia

> A broken spur was chosen as the Divisional sign to mark the 18 dismounted cavalry regiments it comprised.

(Verdin p86, referencing 1917.)

## Cocktail

> While at Kantara there was ample opportunity for officers to visit Cairo. The train journey, however, was a tedious one and history relates that Brigade Headquarters having grown tired of the journey to and from Kantara, eventually moved to Shepherd’s Hotel on the 25th. The hotel barman may have been an Egyptian but he was quick to take advantage of the situation. His speciality of the month was known as the "Broken Spur Cocktail".

(Verdin p138, referencing 1918.)

The best reference for the Broken Spur cocktail found was in the Savoy Cocktail
Book, 1930, by Harry Craddock.

> The York of 1 Egg.
> ⅙ Italian Vermouth.
> ⅔ White Port.
> 1 Teaspoonful Anisette
> Shake well and strain into cocktail glass.

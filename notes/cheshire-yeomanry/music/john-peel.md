# D'ye Ken John Peel

* Words originally by John Woodcock Graves (1795–1886) around 1824
* Sung today to music composed by William Metcalfe (1829–1909) in 1869
* The tune itself has a long history at least as far back as 1695

## According to Gilpin

* Songs and Ballads of Cumberland, 1866, edited by Sidney Gilpin (pseudonym of George Coward)
* Words modified from Woodcock from the original Cumbrian dialect, but with Woodcock's permission
* Gilpin claims it appeared in newspapers before but that this was the first time it appeared formally in print

    D'ye ken John Peel with his coat so gray?
    D'ye ken John Peel at the break of the day?
    D'ye ken John Peel when he's far, far away,
    With his hounds and his horn in the morning?

      'Twas the sound of his horn call'd me from my bed,
      And the cry of his hounds has me oft-times led;
      For Peel's view halloa would 'waken the dead,
      Or a fax from his lair in the morning.

    D'ye ken that bitch whose tongue is death?
    D'ye ken her sons of peerless faith?
    D'ye ken that a fox with his last breath
    Curs'd them all as he died in the morning?

      'Twas the sound of his horn call'd me from my bed...

    Yes, I ken John Peel and auld Ruby, too,
    Ranter and Royal and Bellman as true;
    From the drag to the chase, from the chase to the view,
    From the view to the death in the morning.

      'Twas the sound of his horn call'd me from my bed...

    And I've follow'd John Peel both often and far,
    O'er the rasper-fence and the gate and the bar,
    From Low Denton-holme up to the Scratchmere Scar,
    When we vied for the brush in the morning.

      'Twas the sound of his horn call'd me from my bed...

    Then, here's to John Peel with my heart and soul,
    Come fill--fill to him another strong bowl:
    And we'll follow John Peel thro' fair and thro' foul
    While we're wak'd by his horn in the morning.

      'Twas the sound of his horn call'd me from my bed...

The second edition in 1874 differs:

* 'break of day' rather than 'break of the day'
* 'brought me from my bed' rather than 'call'd me from my bed'

## As per the QOY Regimental Journal, 2016

    D'ye ken John Peel with his coat so gay,
    D'ye ken John Peel at the break of the day,
    D'ye ken John Peel when he's far, far away,
    With his hounds and his horn in the morning?

      For the sound of his horn brought me from my bed,
      And the cry of his hounds which he oft-times led;
      Peel's view halloo would awaken the dead,
      Or the fox from his lair in the morning.

    Yes, I ken John Peel and Ruby too!
    Ranter and Ringwood, Bellman and True,
    From a find to a check, from a check to a view,
    From a view to a death in the morning.

      For the sound of his horn brought me from my bed...

    Then here's to John Peel from my heart and soul,
    Let's drink to his health, let's finish the bowl,
    We'll follow John Peel thro' fair and thro' foul,
    If we want a good hunt in the morning.

      For the sound of his horn brought me from my bed...

    D'ye ken John Peel with his coat so gay?
    He lived at Troutbeck once on a day;
    Now he has gone far, far, far away;
    We shall ne'er hear his voice in the morning.

      For the sound of his horn brought me from my bed...

## As per a handout used by Cheshire Yeomanry Association in 2019

    Do ye ken John Peel with his coat so grey?
    Do ye ken John Peel at the break of day?
    Do ye ken John Peel when he's far, far away
    With his hounds and his horn in the morning.

      Twas the sound of his horn brought me from my bed
      And the cry of his hounds has me oft times led
      For Peel's "VIEW HAL-LOO" would awaken the dead
      Or a fox from his lair in the morning.

    Do ye ken that hound whose voice is death?
    Do ye ken her sons of peerless faith
    Do ye ken that a fox with his last breath
    Cursed them all as he died in the morning?

      Twas the sound of his horn brought me from my bed...

    Yes, I ken John Peel and Ruby, too
    Ranter and Royal, Bellman so true
    From the drag to the chase, from the chase to the view
    From the view to the death in the morning.

      Twas the sound of his horn brought me from my bed...

    And I've followed John Peel both often and far
    O'er the rasper fence and the gate and the bar
    From Low Denton Holme to the Scratchmere Scar
    When we vied for the brush in the morning.

      Twas the sound of his horn brought me from my bed...

    Then here's to John Peel with my heart and soul
    Come fill, fill to him a brimming bowl
    For we'll follow John Peel thro fair or thro foul
    While we're waked by his horn in the morning.

      Twas the sound of his horn brought me from my bed...

## Other verses

    D'ye ken John Peel with his coat so gay?
    He liv'd at Troutbeck once on a day;
    Now he has gone far, away;
    We shall ne'er hear his voice in the morning.
    For the sound of his horn, etc.

    And I've followed John Peel both often and far,
    O'er the rasper fence and the gate and the bar,
    From low Denton Holme up to Scratchmere Scar,
    Where we vie for the brush in the morning
    For the sound of his horn, etc.

## Other variations

* 'coat so gay' rather than 'coat so gray' - local Herdwick wool was gray, but traditional hunting coats are red or hunting pink
* 'For the sound' rather than ''Twas the sound'
* 'find' rather than 'view'
* 'check' rather than 'chase'
* 'From a view to a kill' rather than 'From the view to the death', which is there the James Bond short-story and movie gets they're name from

## Notes

* Ruby, Ranter, Royal, Bellman were names of some of Peel's best hounds.

# Historical note

When the Guidon was presented in 1967 the Cheshire Yeomanry were only authorised to emblazon twelve Battle Honours, so two were not included on the Guidon, that is Egypt 1916-17 and Palestine 1917-18. That's normal – Regiments do not emblazon all their Battle Honours. However this seems to have caused confusion at the time, and critically the 1967 Guidon Programme only lists those actually on the Guidon, and incorrectly states that all the Battle Honours went onto the Guidon. There is also a mistake in Verdin's Regimental history – he lists Egypt but not Palestine. Ever since, whenever we've needed a list of our Battle Honours it looks like we've referred to the Guidon or the Guidon Programme, and have propagated the error from there for the last 55 years. Dinner menus, Regimental Journals, and even subsequent Guidon Programmes have omitted these two Battle Honours.

# Broken Spur

* 74th (Yeomanry) Division

> A broken spur was chosen as the Divisional sign to mark the 18 dismounted cavalry regiments it comprised.

Chosen by Maj Gen E S Girdwood.

> While at Kantara there was ample opportunity for officers to visit Cairo. The train journey, however, was a tedious one and history relates that Brigade Headquarters having grown tired of the journey to and from Kantara, eventually moved to Shepherd’s Hotel on the 25th. The hotel barman may have been an Egyptian but he was quick to take advantage of the situation. His speciality of the month was known as the “Broken Spur Cocktail”.
